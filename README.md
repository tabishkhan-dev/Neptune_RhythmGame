## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The project follows a **modular architecture** with separated responsibilities:

| Script | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `AudioManager.cs` | Handles audio playback, BPM configuration, and accurate song timing using DSP clock. |
| `BeatSpawner.cs` | Spawns beats at each calculated interval (`SecondsPerBeat`). |
| `BeatMovement.cs` | Moves beats visually toward the player for rhythm feedback. |
| `InputHandler.cs` | Detects player clicks and evaluates timing accuracy. |
| `FeedbackUI.cs` | Displays feedback text (Perfect, Good, Miss) and final score summary. |

---

## 🕹️ Gameplay Summary
- Click or tap **in rhythm** with the song’s beats.  
- Timing is judged as:
  - 🎯 **Perfect:** ±100 ms  
  - 👍 **Good:** ±220 ms  
  - ❌ **Miss:** >220 ms  
- At the end of the track, a **score summary** appears showing performance.

## 🧩 Notes & Improvements
- The BPM is fixed at **120** for simplicity.  
- Latency compensation of **–100 ms** ensures realistic PC response.  
- Possible future improvements:
  - Waveform-based beat detection.  
  - Visual hit effects & combo counter.  
  - Background animations and difficulty levels.  
  - Menu system with replay/reset.
